    We assume that we are making predictions over a vocabulary of size V for each timestep of a
    timeseries of length T, over a minibatch of size N. The input x gives scores for all vocabulary
    elements at all timesteps, and y gives the indices of the ground-truth element at each timestep.
    We use a cross-entropy loss at each timestep, summing the loss over all timesteps and averaging
    across the minibatch.

    As an additional complication, we may want to ignore the model output at some timesteps, since
    sequences of different length may have been combined into a minibatch and padded with NULL
    tokens. The optional mask argument tells us which elements should contribute to the loss.

    Inputs:
    - x: Input scores, of shape (N, T, V)
    - y: Ground-truth indices, of shape (N, T) where each element is in the range
         0 <= y[i, t] < V
